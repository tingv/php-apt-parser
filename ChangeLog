2007-03-01  Daniel Leidert  <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>, 1.3.5:
	* parse-apt-files.inc:
	  - Make $version a local variable. Seems the global thing doesn't
	    work here and leads to wrongly assumed .build and .changes files.
	* LICENSE:
	  - Fixed copyright.

2007-03-01  Daniel Leidert  <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>, 1.3.4:
	* parse-apt-files.inc:
	  - Added some more classes to allow more customization.

2007-02-28  Daniel Leidert  <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>, 1.3.3:
	* parse-apt-files.inc:
	  - Moved the .changes and .build detection into two functions:
	    chb_file_link_from_directory() opens the given directory and reads
	    all files with the given extension. To check, if the file belongs
	    to a package, it calls chb_file_match(). This function creates a
	    string from the given values and tests, if the filename begings
	    with this string. This change was made, because the code to check
	    for .changes and .build files was very simlar.
	    This code change also reverts a change made to link-target
	    creation, made by Damián Viano (read Alioth bug #304089 for more
	    information). Because I also did not find out, for what $some_bin
	    was used, this part was also removed and the code to determine the
	    search path simplified.
	  - I further "fixed" the indentation for function parse_section.
	  - Added some more documentation.

2007-02-28  Daniel Leidert  <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>, 1.3.2:
	* ChangeLog: Added missing entries for last change.
	* parse-apt-files.inc:
	  - Fixed bugs in the .build files search/link creation code
	    introduced in revision 21 (1.3.1).
	  - Reorganized the steps we do without further code-changes.
	  - Added some information to the header comment.

2006-11-19  Daniel Leidert  <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>, 1.3.1:
	* parse-apt-files.inc:
	  - Fixed Alioth bug #304143. I tried to read a non-existing field in
	    Sources and it seems, this confused the script a bit.
	    (http://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?func=detail&aid=304143&group_id=30953&atid=412507)

2006-06-24  Damián Viano  <debian@damianv.com.ar>, 1.3.0:

	    when runned as cgi
	  - smart striping absolute paths from changes and buildlog files based on
	    $base_url

	    beggining of a description line

2006-01-04, Daniel Leidert <daniel.leidert@wgdd.de>, 1.2.7:
	* parse-apt-files.inc: 
	  - when searching for .changes and .build files, the search failed, if
	  	version number contained x:up_ver-deb_ver (e.g.  3:3.0.5-1). We now
	  	remove a leading 'x:' from the version number and finally find our
	  	files.
